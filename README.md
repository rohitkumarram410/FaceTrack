# 📸 FaceTrack: Real-Time Attendance
 🚀 Smart AI System for Attendance Using Facial Recognition 


---

## 📜 Project Overview  
The **Real-Time Face-Based Attendance System** is an AI-powered solution designed to automate and simplify attendance tracking in modern classrooms and workplaces. Utilizing facial recognition and computer vision, the system captures live video or image input to detect and identify individuals with high accuracy. Attendance data is securely logged into a MySQL database, ensuring a contactless, efficient, and error-free process.

Integrated with class schedules, the system prevents duplicate entries and automates record-keeping, significantly reducing manual workload. It provides real-time access to attendance records, enhances security, and supports scalable deployment in institutions and organizations looking for a smart and modern attendance solution.
